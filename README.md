# NAVODITA-INFOTECH_cyber-defense-System
A client-side Cyber Defense System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript demonstrating password strength validation, login attempt tracking, and basic brute-force attack prevention.
Cyber Defense System

A client-side cybersecurity demonstration project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project simulates basic authentication security mechanisms such as password validation, login attempt limits, and activity logging.

# 🚀 Overview

The Cyber Defense System demonstrates how modern applications protect user accounts from weak passwords and brute-force attacks.

It focuses on implementing password policies and monitoring login behavior to improve account security awareness.

# 🛡️ Features

# 🔑 Password Strength Validation

Minimum 8 characters

At least 1 uppercase letter

At least 1 number

At least 1 special character

Real-time strength indicator (Weak / Medium / Strong)

# 🔐 Secure Login Simulation

No hard-coded passwords

Login allowed only if password meets security policy

# 🚫 Brute-Force Protection

Limited login attempts per user

Account lock simulation after multiple failed attempts

# 📊 Security Logs

Tracks failed login attempts

Tracks successful logins

Displays real-time security events

# 💻 Technologies Used

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understanding password policy enforcement

Implementing client-side authentication logic

Simulating brute-force attack prevention

Managing login attempt tracking

Logging and monitoring security events

# 🌍 Real-World Relevance

Inspired by security mechanisms used in platforms such as:

Gmail

Banking applications

Social media platforms

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is an educational client-side demonstration and is not intended for production-level authentication systems.
